# Spring Boot User Registration App Using JSP
# Spring Boot User Login and Registration

This is a **Spring Boot** project for user **login** and **registration** functionality. Jsp's are used as UI components for user interactions, following the **MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture**.

## Features
- **User Registration**: Users can sign up with an email, username, and password (passwords are hashed for security).
- **User Login**: Users can log in with email/username and password authentication.


## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot** (Backend)
  - Spring MVC for **Controller, Service, and Repository layers**.


## Project Structure
- **Model**: Represents the entities, such as User, Role, etc.
- **Controller**: Handles HTTP requests, processes user input, and returns appropriate views.
- **Service**: Contains the business logic (e.g., registering users, authenticating users).
- **Repository**: Interacts with the database to fetch and persist data (e.g., User repository).
